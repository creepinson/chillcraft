# Minecraft: A Story

It's a cool 2012 summer night. Your parents are asleep, but you can't seem to.
You notice your computer on your bedside table. Opening it, you hear the sound of a newly restarted Mac or Windows computer. You frantically turn down the volume, so your parents don't wake up. Scrolling through your applications, you remember that you recently bought some sort of game. "Minecraft."
You start up the game, an orange logo lights up the blank white of the screen. "Mojang."
You create a new world. You slowly learn the basics, chopping wood, mining coal, creating a small house.
The next day, you start the computer up again after school. You keep advancing, and over the next few months you defeat the wither, gather diamonds, and eventually reach the end.
The dragon threatens you, but you have your trusty bow ready.
One, two, three, four blows...
After a while, the dragon is defeated and you return to the overworld.
The game is done.
You shut off your computer.
Time passes.


It's 2019, you're trying to find lost papers for a test. You're panicked, fishing through all of the items in your closet.
You feel something.
It's your old computer. 
You charge it, and then turn it on again. You haven't done it since you got a new computer in 2015.
You hear the same sound. Slower this time, but it still invokes the calm feeling of your younger days.


"This will be fun" you mutter to yourself as you look through all of your apps.


You find it.


Minecraft. You open it, and despite being offered a new update you pass by it. Java opens. The Mojang logo flashes. You're welcomed back to Minecraft version 1.2.


You click "Single Player" to find one world.
"My World"
When you start the world, the memories flood back. Memories of a cool summer night when you turned on your new computer and found the game you played for so long.
Everything is the same, your wolves welcome you. The computer is slower now, but Minecraft is still playable.


You visit all the structures you built. All the hard work.


Your mother calls you to the kitchen. It's the first day of a new school year.


You shut off your computer. Saying goodbye to your wolves, your farm, your house you made out of dirt and cobblestone when you first started the game.
Goodbye for the last time.


But you remember your login for the game as well.


After school, you open your new computer, going to minecraft.net. You download the game, log in, and update to the latest version.
Everything is so different now. So many new things to discover.


You create a new world.


Your adventure starts again, after all this time. A new journey.
More fun to be had.
